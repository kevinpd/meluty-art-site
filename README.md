# Meluty Art Site | Final Year Major Project
 This is the website build of Meluty Art Portfolio. This was my Major Project in University in my final year and working with a client to finish their website. Going through an entire process from research to final build and testing.

## How I started
I started by meeting with my client and outlining the key design requirements and finding/ extracting exactly what they wanted. I also used this time to explain the process and the steps that I will be taking to make sure they get the best website they can from me. Using the Agile Waterfall methodology, I explained how each week there would be meetings whether it be online or in person and what these meetings would entail.

## Building Process
### Research
1) Creating a Gantt Chart -  Manage the times and deadlines for each step within the process and handle future meetings. This will and should be updated regularly as things change.

2) Client Site User Research - Gathering information about what user range they would be targeting and their opinions on current websites.

3) Client Proposal - This was a proposal created by me, the developer, and given to the client so that they know what to be expecting of the website and to also outline what they will not be getting.

4) Competitor Analysis - This is finding competitors of the client and comparing them with each other to find the downfalls of these websites and the features and designs that they have in common.

5) Personas - Putting the user at the centre of the design to create the best possible user experience that can be offered. These personas create an overall character to represent a group of people.

6) User Journey - Using the Personas to create a User Journey Map to show their possible experience while using our website. This will help outline where their Pains are so that I can outline the opportunities to create a better experience for users.

7) Site Plan - The site plan is the official website architecture, which is created using client research done via Treejack and Card Sorting. This is done via sticky notes as it is easy to re-arrange and move around but also make comments.

8) Content Delivery Schedule - This will be a continuously updated document that highlights the deadlines and what is needed for both the client and the developer.

9) Moodboards - A document that has gathered all inspiring and possible features and designs that the website will use. Using graphics to show the overall feel of the website.

10) Styleguide - Styleguides help the developer think less about the design and concentrate more on the website build. It helps by showing the font types, colours and other feature designs that will be used within the website like buttons. 

11) Sketches - This is the low-fidelity design version of the website. Using nothing but pen and pad to create a layout that uses the information gathered from past research to create a website that highlights important information and buttons.

12) Wireframes - Using Figma to create a website high-fidelity design for both mobile and desktop that will have colours and content.

13) Product Build - Building the website using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. While thinking about web performance by making sure the code inside the head tags are placed correctly and images are compressed.

14) User Testing - Testing the website on real users and getting feedback by using video capture and 'think aloud' so that their thought process can be analysed to improve the website for launch.
